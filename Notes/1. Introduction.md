# 1. Introduction

## 1.1. What is database

**base**: the main place where a person lives and works, or a place that a company does business from.

**database**: A database is an organized collection of data stored and accessed electronically from a computer

**DBMS**: A database-management system (DBMS) is a collection of interrelated data and a set of programs to access those data

**two base goal for a DBMS**: convenient and efficient

## 1.2. database application

- E-commerce
- Enterprise Organizations
- Standalone Application: SQLite

### 1.2.1. application categories

- online transaction processing
  - low delay
- data analysis
  - e.g. beers and diapers

## 1.3. Role of the database

In other words, why file-based database is not as good as expected?

- **File processing system's disadvantage**
  - **data redundancy and inconsistency**
    - Data redundancy means higher storage costs, and multiple copies of the same data can lead to data inconsistencies.
  - **data isolation**
    - The data is scattered in different files and may also use different formats. Therefore, it is difficult to write new programs to access the data.
  - **difficulty in accessing data**
  - **integrity problem**
    - Certain values may be subject to certain constraints. For example, salary > 0. Although it is possible to implement the constraint by adding code to the program, it is not flexible enough. For example, new constraints may be added.
  - **concurrent-access anomalies**
    - Assuming you have $100,000 in your account and two expenditures at the same moment ($10,000 and $20,000 respectively), the final result may be incorrect ($90,000 or $80,000).
  - **atomicity problems**
    - You are in the process of making a payment and the system crashes, at this point it may appear that your money is deducted but the object is not received

==Keep in mind the trade-off concept: a file-processing system and a database system (DBMS) are not completely opposed to each other; use the right system for the right situation.==

- When to use DBMS
  - highly valuable
  - relatively Larger
  - accessed by multiple users and applications

## 1.4. view of data

- Abstraction: help you to Ignore irrelevant details

- data model: A collection of conceptualization tools that describe data, data relationships, data semantics, and consistency constraints.
  - relational model: table is relation $\leftarrow$  ==Most commonly used models==
    ![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250227203225.png)
  - entity-relationship model: the (E-R) data model uses a collection of basic objects, called entities, and relationships among these objects. $\leftarrow$ ==Widely used in database design==.
  - semi-structured data model: individual data items of the same type may have different sets of attributes. $\leftarrow$ ==Widely used in internet and big data scenarios==
  - object-based data model
  - network model/ hierarchy model

- schema and instance
  - schema: The overall design of the database (translated as "綱要" in Taiwan) can be categorized into physical schema, logical schema, and sub-schema according to the different levels of data abstraction.
  - Instance: A collection of information stored in the database at a specific moment in time.

## 1.5. database language

The database system provides:

- data-definition language: defines the database schema
- data-manipulation language: expresses database queries and updates.

SQL (Structured Query Language) is the current mainstream. It is a declarative language, i.e., it focuses on What, not How.

- DDL: Defines database structure (e.g., CREATE, ALTER, DROP).
- DML: Manipulates data within the database (e.g., SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).

## 1.6. Database System Architecture

too complex to understand, and meaningless as well.

- Tips：
  ![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250227204542.png)
- It's silly to connect a database system directly to an application like this on the left
