# 1. The relational database good form

WHY a small schema rather than big one

- Redundancy
- Poor maintainability

lossless decomposition

$$
\Pi_{R_{1}}(r) \bowtie \Pi_{R_{2}}(r) =r
$$

We say that a relational schema is a "good form", meaning that it has `no information redundancy`. The rationale behind this is to check for conformity to the ` normal form  `and decompose it as `needed`.

## 1.1. First Normal Norm

basic demand for a relational database

Key word: Atomic Non-repeating Unique value

## 1.2. functional dependencies

- attribute set: Greek alphabet
- schema: r(R), where r is relation name, R is attribute list
- super key: K

> Defination
> Consider a relation schema $r(R)$ , place $\alpha \subseteq R$ and $\beta \subseteq$R,
> given an instance of $r(R)$ , we say this instance satisfy functional dependencies $\alpha \rightarrow \beta$ if for all pair of tuple, if $t_{1}[\alpha]=t_{2}[\alpha]$ ,then $t_{1}[\beta]=t_{2}[\beta]$

### 1.2.1. trivial dependancy

> if $\beta \subseteq \alpha$ , then functional dependency $\alpha \rightarrow \beta$ is trivial

### 1.2.2. dependency closure

Since functional dependency can do inference, functional dependency can compose `closure` , and use $F^{+}$ to represent the closure of set F

**If at least one of the following functional dependencies belongs to $F^+$, then $R_1$ and $R_2$ constitute a lossless decomposition of R:

- $R_{1} \cap R_{2} \rightarrow R_{1}$
- $R_{1} \cap R_{2} \rightarrow R_{2}$

## 1.3. Boyce-Codd Normal Form(BCNF)

> A relational schema R with a functional dependency set F belongs to BCNF if, for all functional dependencies in $F^{+}$ of the form $\alpha \rightarrow \beta$, at least one of the following holds:
>
> - $\alpha \rightarrow \beta$ is trivial functional dependency
> - $\alpha$ is one of a super key of R

Example:
Assuming a teacher has multiple addresses, decompose the following relational schema so that it satisfies BCNF.

inst(ID, name, street, city)

| ID    | name | street        | city     |
| ----- | ---- | ------------- | -------- |
| 22222 | Bob  | Liulin        | ChengDu  |
| 22222 | Bob  | Guanghua      | ChengDu  |
| 33333 | Mike | Dongchuan Rd. | Shanghai |

first, ID ->name, then prove not satisfy BCNF
so
IN(ID, name)
and
ins_(ID, street, city)

### 1.3.1. BCNF decomposition algo
