# 1. Advanced SQL

## 1.1. View

### 1.1.1. Define a View

Virtual relationship, only information is retained, not stored or

```sql
create view v 
as 
<query-expression>
```

### 1.1.2. use a view

Views are not pre-computed and stored, but are re-computed by executing queries when virtual relationships are used.
In terms of SQL query syntax, there is no difference between a "view" and a normal "relationship".
Some databases allow views to be stored and ensure that if a relationship changes, the corresponding view is updated.Such a view is called a materialized view.

## 1.2. authorization

In other words, Define access rights (privilege)

### 1.2.1. authorization

Read, insert, update, delete
`GRANT <authority list> ON <relationship or view> TO <user or role>`

```sql
GRANT SELECT 
ON department
TO LiLei

```

### 1.2.2. Role

in PG, it consistently use of role for users and groups

steps:

1. create role : `CREATE ROLE lilei WITH LOGIN PASSWORD '123456';`
2. authorize: `GRANT SELECT ON department TO lilei;`

then it can use `SELECT` query.

## 1.3. Functions and procedures

### 1.3.1. Define a function

SQL itself contains default functions such as the AVG() function.

```sql
SELECT AVG(salary)
FROM instructor
GROUP BY length(name);
```

But we can custom new function:

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION
add(integer,integer) RETURNS integer 
AS 'select $1+$2;'
LANGUAGE SQL;


-- Advanced way
CREATE FUNCTION multiply(i integer, j integer)
RETURNS integer AS
$$
BEGIN
	RETURN i*j;
END;
$$
LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

### 1.3.2. Define a procedure

In the real world an action often involves multiple reads and writes to the database. For example, when placing an order on Taobao, the database needs to 1) add the order and 2) add the delivery information.

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE 
	buy(id varchar(50), product text, address text) 
AS $$ 
	INSERT INTO order(id, product) VALUES($1, $2); 
	INSERT INTO deliver VALUES($2, $3); 
	$$ 
LANGUAGE SQL;
```

## 1.4. Trigger

A trigger is a statement that the system executes automatically as a side effect of a modification to the database.

To define a trigger, we must:

- Specify when a trigger is to be executed. This is broken up into an event that causes the trigger to be checked and a condition that must be satisfied for trigger execution to proceed.
- Specify the actions to be taken when the trigger executes.

### 1.4.1. When to use

Triggers can be used to implement certain integrity constraints that cannot be specified using the constraint mechanism of SQL . Triggers are also useful mechanisms for alerting humans or for starting certain tasks automatically when certain conditions are met.

Example：we could design a trigger that, whenever a tuple is inserted into the takes relation, updates the tuple in the student relation for the student taking the course by adding the number of credits for the course to the student’s total credits

Note: triggers usually cannot be used outside the database

## 1.5. Accessing databases using a programming language

### 1.5.1. background knowledge

B-S framework(Browser/Server framework)
e.g.: jdbc:postgresql :// localhost : 5432 / mydb $\leftrightarrow$ Protocol:// Server: port/...

### 1.5.2. Python Accessing the Database

in python, recommend `psycopg2`

### 1.5.3. ORM

However, embedding SQL code directly inside a program can be a nightmare for large projects.

- SQL code cannot be verified to be correct at compile time
- Cannot mask differences between DBMSs

to solve, object-relational mapping is now  widely used

Though it is Oracle, MySQL, pg can also use sqlalchemy one of the most popular ORM framework

```python
import oracledb
import pandas as pd
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

# Initialize the Oracle client
oracledb.init_oracle_client(lib_dir=r"E:\app\username\product\11.2.0\dbhome_1\bin")

# Connection parameters
username = "SYSTEM"
password = 
host = "localhost"
port = "1522"
service_name = "orcl"

# create  SQLAlchemy engine
connection_string = f"oracle+oracledb://{username}:{password}@{host}:{port}/?service_name={service_name}"
engine = create_engine(connection_string)


#  query
# query = ""
# df = pd.read_sql(query, con=engine)
```

## 1.6. SQL Injection

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcaiKgQU6VE>

SQL statements constructed using simple string concatenation run the risk of SQL injection, but you can avoid this problem by using ORM or PreparedStatement.

If the logic for user login is `SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '{name}' AND pswd = '{pswd}'`, then all the

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='zhongpu' AND pswd='' or '1'='1';

SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='zhongpu' AND pswd='' or 1='1';
```

are eternal for TRUE statements can go directly to the database

To prevent SQL injection, you should use the parameterized query or prepared statement. This ensures that user input is processed correctly and not embedded directly into the SQL statement:
e.g.：

```python
import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Use of parameterized queries
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = ? AND pswd = ?", (name, pswd))

```
