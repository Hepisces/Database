# 1. key

A way to **distinguish** between **different tuples** in a given relation.

- super key: A collection of **one or more attributes**, such that the combination of attributes allows us to **uniquely identify** a tuple in a relation.

- candidate key: Its true subset cannot form a super key of a super key (also called "minimal super key").
  - Also not unique
- primary key: Candidate key that is selected by the database designer.
  - use `underline` to identify
  - _**atomicity**_
- foreign key:
  - e.g. Attribute `dept_name` is a **foreign key** from instructor, **referencing** department.
    instructor(ID, name, dept_name, salary);
    department(dept_name, building, budget)
  - referencing relation and referenced relation
  - **Note: The foreign key does not necessarily have the same name as the primary key to which it is referentially related.**
