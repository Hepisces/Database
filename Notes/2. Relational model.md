# 1. Relational model

consists of a collection of tables

- Relation:
  - Given sets X and Y , the Cartesian product $X \times Y$ is defined as $\{(x,y)| x\in X , y \in Y\}$ and its elements called ordered pairs
  - A binary relation R over sets X and Y is a subset of $X \times  Y$.

## 1.1. the structure of relational model

|  database | Excel  |
| :-------: | ------ |
|  relation | table  |
|   tuple   | row    |
| attribute | column |

**A row in a table represents a relationship among a set of values.**

**The tuples here are not in order, but can be repeated**

## 1.2. relation schema

- database schema: Logical design of the database
- database instance: A snapshot of the data in the database at a given moment

Similarly, there is a relation schema and a relation instance.

- relation schema: The name of a relation and the set of attributes for a relation
  - e.g. The relation schema of this table
    ![attachments/Pasted image 20250306185420.png](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250306185420.png)
    is `instructor(ID, name, dept_name, salary)`
