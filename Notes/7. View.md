# 7. View

## 7.1. Define a View

Virtual relationship, only information is retained, not stored or

```sql
create view v 
as 
<query-expression>
```

## 7.2. use a view

Views are not pre-computed and stored, but are re-computed by executing queries when virtual relationships are used.
In terms of SQL query syntax, there is no difference between a "view" and a normal "relationship".
Some databases allow views to be stored and ensure that if a relationship changes, the corresponding view is updated.Such a view is called a materialized view.
