## Links to Assignments

For ease of reading, here are direct links to the answer files for each assignment.

- [1. challenge](1.%20challenge/challenge_solve.md)
- [2. relational_model](2.%20relational_model/relational_model_solve.md)
- [3. basic_sql](3.%20basic_sql/basic_sql_solve.md)
- [4. lab_sql](4.%20lab_sql/lab_sql_solve.md)
- [5. sql](5.%20sql/sql_solve.md)

## Description


**Each folder will typically contain the following contents:**

- **The `original assignment file`**, taken from the course git repository (see README.md in the root directory of this repository for directions), without any naming changes unless necessary(e.g. the original file is named `README.md`), and consistent with the original repository md file.
- **The `solution file`**, completed by me according to the requirements of the assignment, and submitted to my git repository, the naming format is usually `{folder name}_solve.md`
- **The `code` folder**, contains all the code used, the code usually has simple comments, the relevant analysis will be listed in the job solution file. **However, if it is a sql file, it will be placed in the `code` folder in the root directory**, and there will be a link to the sql file in the solution file.
- **The `reference` folder**, contains all the references, etc., usually in pdf format, usually listed in the solution file.
- **The `others` folder**, contains other related files,such as all images and so on.

## Directory Structure

This section will show the main directory structure, and considering that there may be too many files in `code` and `reference`, I will not list them all.
